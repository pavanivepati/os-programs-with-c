What is Shortest Job First?
This is an approach which considers the next CPU burst. 
Each process posses its next CPU burst. 
When CPU is available, the process having the smallest next CPU burst is allocated CPU.

Now it may happen that two or more processes have the same next CPU burst.
Then which process to allocate will be decided as per FCFS scheduling.

Advantages:
This algorithm is simple to implement.

Does not depend on any priority of the process. 
The smallest burst time is the higher priority consideration.

It provides good CPU utilization than FCFS (First Come First Search).

Waiting time and turn around time of each process is reduced, reducing the average waiting time and turn around the time of the system as compared to FCFS.

Disadvantages:
Waiting time of some processes still high due to the long burst time of the processes, in case of non-preemptive scheduling.

In the case of non-preemptive scheduling, it may act as a uni-processing operating system.

In the case of preemptive scheduling, context switch is required.

And in preemptive scheduling, turn around time may get increased.

There are two schemes with this type of scheduling:

Non-preemptive: Once the CPU is allocated to a process, it can not be preempted until it completes its CPU burst.

Preemptive: If a new process arrives with CPU burst length less than remaining time of current execution process, preempt the current process. 
This scheme is known as Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF).
